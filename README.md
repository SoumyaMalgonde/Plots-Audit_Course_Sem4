# Audit_Course_Semester4

For my audit course in semester 4, I had to plot agricultural datasets and analyse them.<br>
This repository contains my work of plotting using python.<br>
Dataset taken from - https://www.kaggle.com/srinivas1/agricuture-crops-production-in-india?select=datafile+%281%29.csv <br>
(I referred to some publicly available notebooks)
